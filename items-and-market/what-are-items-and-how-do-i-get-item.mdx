Item are objects you can get when completing tasks on **Faucet Crypto**, and are used to boost various features on the website. Much like RPG games where you can collect items to boost your in-game play, the same idea is also applicable here: you can randomly get Items when completing tasks or simply [buy one from the Market](https://knowledge-base.faucetcrypto.com/article/53-how-to-buy-items-from-the-market) with Coins.

- **_Potion_**
- **_Bracelet_**
- **_Silver Ring_**
- **_Gold Ring_**
- **_Gem_**
