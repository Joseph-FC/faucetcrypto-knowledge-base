title: "How to buy Items from the Market?"
---

This is pretty straightforward as the same steps in the previous guide about [selling your item](https://faucetcrypto.mintlify.app/items-and-market/how-to-sell-items-or-cancel-a-sell-order?). The difference is that now you're **buying** from the Market. To buy items from the market, please follow the step-by-step guide below.

As an illustration in this guide, we'll be buying a _Rare Commission Gold Ring_.

1. **Login** to your **Account**
2. Scroll down the left-side menu to the **COMMUNITY** section, and click on the **Items Market** option/page under it
