Selling your Items is another cool way of earning coins on **Faucet Crypto**. To sell your items, you must open an order in the _Items Market_ for users to fill the order (in other words, for users to buy your Item or Items).

To place/sell your Items in the Market, please follow the step-by-step guide below. As an illustration in this guide, we'll be selling a _Commission Bracelet_.

1. **Login** to your **Account**
2. Scroll down the left-side menu to the **COMMUNITY** section, and click on the **Items Market** option/page under it
