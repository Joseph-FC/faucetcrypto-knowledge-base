Selling your Items is another cool way of earning coins on **Faucet Crypto**. To sell your items, you must open an order in the _Items Market_ for users to fill the order (in other words, for users to buy your Item or Items).

To place/sell your Items in the Market, please follow the step-by-step guide below. As an illustration in this guide, we'll be selling a _Commission Bracelet_.

1. **Login** to your **Account**
2. Scroll down the left-side menu to the **COMMUNITY** section, and click on the **Items Market** option/page under it

Hurray\! You have just successfully placed your Item on the _Market_ for sell. Now you have to wait for other users to buy the Item. How much time it takes for your Item to be bought by other users is dependent on the price offer.
