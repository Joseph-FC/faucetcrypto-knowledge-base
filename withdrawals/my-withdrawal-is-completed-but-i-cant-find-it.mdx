title: "My withdrawal is completed but I can't find it"

**Faucet Crypto** sends out withdrawals directly through the blockchain â€” with **transaction hash** (**_TxID_**) **generated** when the withdrawal process is completed. This method ensures **everything is transparent**, meaning anyone with the transaction hash/ID can search or view the withdrawal transaction in a block explorer and see the confirmation status, recipient address, date & time of the transaction alongside many other details.

If you made a withdrawal, which is now labelled "Completed" in your withdrawal history, but you cannot seem to find nor see the coins reflect in your wallet app, here's a series of steps you should follow to accurately track the coins:

1. First, ensure you had used a correct/valid address for the respective blockchain network prior to initially clicking "Submit withdraw" when withdrawing (\*see this guide about "How to withdraw from Faucet Crypto"). If YES, proceed to #2 below.
2. Scroll down the left-side menu to the PROFILE section, and click on the Withdraw option/page to open it up, then click on "Open" where it says "Withdrawal History" to show your full Withdrawal History
