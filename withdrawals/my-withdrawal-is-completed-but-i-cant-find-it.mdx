**Faucet Crypto** sends out withdrawals directly through the blockchain â€” with **transaction hash** (**_TxID_**) **generated** when the withdrawal process is completed. This method ensures **everything is transparent**, meaning anyone with the transaction hash/ID can search or view the withdrawal transaction in a block explorer and see the confirmation status, recipient address, date & time of the transaction alongside many other details.

If you made a withdrawal, which is now labelled "_Completed_" in your withdrawal history, but you cannot seem to find nor see the coins reflect in your wallet app, here's a series of steps you should follow to accurately track the coins:

1. First, ensure you had used a **correct/valid address for the respective blockchain network** prior to initially clicking "_Submit withdraw_" when withdrawing (see [this guide](https://faucetcrypto.mintlify.app/withdrawals/how-to-withdraw-from-faucetcrypto?) about "_How to withdraw from Faucet Crypto_"). If _YES_, proceed to #2 below.
2. Scroll down the left-side menu to the **PROFILE** section, and click on the **Withdraw** option/page to open it up, then click on "_Open_" where it says "**Withdrawal History**" to show your full Withdrawal History

3. Once your full Withdrawal History shows, **click on the specific withdrawal you have an issue** with to bring up more details about it ie. Transaction flow from "_Submission_", "_Processing_" to "_Completed_" (including date & time stamps); Amount of Coins withdrawn and the equivalent crypto amount to be received; Your withdrawal address; and most importantly, **the transaction hash/ID** (abbreviated as **TxID**)

4. **The transaction hash/ID (TxID) is the single unique identifier to verify that your withdrawal was sent**, and it is what you will use in tracking your transaction on a **Block Explorer** to confirm with 100% certainty

<Tip>
  [[[**_A Block Explorer is simply a web application that lets you 'peek inside the blockchain', searching transactions, addresses, and even Live activity. Each blockchain network has at least one block explorer. For example, mempool.space is a versatile block explorer for Bitcoin network; polygonscan.com is a block explorer for Polygon network; and in some cases, you may find a block explorer that supports multiple networks eg. blockchair.com_**](https://blockchair.com)](https://polygonscan.com)](https://mempool.space)
</Tip>

5. That said, **at the Withdrawal Details Modal**, either click the "_copy_" icon to **copy the TxID** and manually input/paste it into a related Block Explorer for the associated crypto and search **OR simply click the "_Link_" icon** to automatically open it in it's related Block Explorer and track the transaction.
6. Once it opens, generally (but using this Polygon withdrawal as an example on [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com)) pay attention to a section that says "**Status**" (and/or "**No. of Confirmations**" for some network block explorers). **Being marked as 'Success', 'Confirmed', 'Successful' or anything similar... with 1 or more No. of Confirmations is 100% verifiable assurance that the transaction was accurately sent**. You can also see your address, amount transacted and other details pertaining to the whole withdrawal.
