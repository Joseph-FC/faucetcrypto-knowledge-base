title: "What is a Trust Score?"
---

The Trust Score is a system put in place in order to reduce abuse of Offerwalls. It operates automatically based on your activity on Offerwalls. You start with **40 points**, and if your account reaches **0 points**, you will no longer be able to complete Offerwalls.

For each chargeback or fraud detected for an activity in an Offerwall, you will lose **10 Trust Score points**. For each completed/valid Offer, you will get **2 points back** (the maximum points at a time being 40). If the task reward is over **6250 Coins**, it will be held for 24 hours. If it is detected as fraud, you will **lose 5 points**.
