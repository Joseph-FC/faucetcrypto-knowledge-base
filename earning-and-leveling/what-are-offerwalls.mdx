title: "What are Offerwalls?"
---

**Offerwalls** are third-party services that pay users for completing tasks on their page. These are high-paying tasks that can range from watching videos (along with the ads they carry), visiting web pages, filling out surveys, installing apps and signing up for services.

Keep in mind that most tasks available on the Offerwall page (_e.g._ surveys) may be restricted to specific locations. For example, users residing in **USA**, **CANADA**, **AUSTRALIA**, **UK**, **NEW ZEALAND**, and a few **EU** Countries are mostly targeted for survey tasks. Do not fret, you will be notified when they become available for your location.
