title: "I have noticed an Offerwall chargeback on my account. What can I do?"
---

**Chargebacks refer to losing out on a reward and/or losing specified Trust Score credits on your account for an offer/survey you participated in when a discrepancy is detected by the Offerwall provider** (irrespective of whether the task had been recorded as _"successful"_ at the end). If the coin rewards were credited, a chargeback will result in you losing 10 Trust Score credits; If the coin reward is on hold (but not yet credited), a chargeback will result in the cancellation of the reward in it's entirety and a deduction of 5 Trust Score credits from your account. (To understand what a Trust Score is, please see [this guide](https://knowledge-base.faucetcrypto.com/article/63-what-is-a-trust-score)).

Some discrepancies an Offerwall provider can pick up can arise due to various reasons, including but not limited to, fraudulent activity, non-matching profile answers provided during the offer/survey completion process, speed-answering a survey, failing trick questions within the offer/survey, or violations of the Offerwall provider's terms and conditions amongst others.

## **What can I do to resolve this?**

First, **offers & surveys are provided by third-party services and we cannot influence their eligibility criteria, chargeback reviews or effect a resolution on the matter**. However, we do understand that dealing with this situation can be frustrating, especially if you're confident you followed the instructions.

On your part, here are some steps you can take:

1. **Understand why the chargeback occured:** Reach out to the Offerwall's Support (not Faucet Crypto Support Center). To get in touch with an Offerwall provider, check for a _"Contact Us"_ or _"Support"_ section on their website.
2. **Review the offer details:** Carefully go through the offer requirements if possible (and make this a point to do in any future offers you wish to participate in). Make sure to check for any criteria that may have been overlooked.
3. **Provide evidence of completion (if available):** Gather evidence like screenshots, screen-recordings & completion dates or any other proof of completion and provide them to the Offerwall's support team.
4. ****Be polite and respectful: Be polite and professional in your communication with the Offerwall's support team. Resolving chargebacks can take time.****Â Allow the Offerwall's support team adequate time to investigate your case.

In many cases, a chargeback may not be resolved to your satisfaction/expectations. It is important that you keep an open-mind with a positive attitude and go on to complete many other offers while applying the tips in this article).
