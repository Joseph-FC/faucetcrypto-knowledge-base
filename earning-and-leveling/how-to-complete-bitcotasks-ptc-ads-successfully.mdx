...it is important to note that, **Bitcotasks operates two (2) variants of PTC ads**. Hence, in some cases at this step, instead of getting a "_Start View Ad_" button, you'll see a **countdown represented by a blue bar progressively fill up automatically**. Illustrated in the image below:

5. Anyway, once you click "**_Start View Ad_**" you will be redirected and the ad to be viewed will open up in a new tab while you get a countdown signifying how much time is left for you to remain on the ad page

6. When the **countdown elapses** (or as in the 2nd type of Bitcotasks PTC ads, the blue progressive bar completely fills up), you'll **solve a captcha** on the Bitcotasks page. Once solved correctly, you'll see a **confirmative message at the top left corner** signifying you have successfully viewed the ad
