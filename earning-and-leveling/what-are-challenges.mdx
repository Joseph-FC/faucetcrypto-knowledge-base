Challenges are another unique way to earn extra rewards for completing a certain amount of tasks assigned to you by **Faucet Crypto**. There are two (2) classes of Challenges: \*\*Rotative Challenges \*\*and **Special Challenges**.

Both classes are available to claim at the Challenge page in the side menu after you complete them individually.

- **Rotative Challenges** — These challenges appear at random and have a time limit until they get claimed. You are required to complete a certain amount of tasks within their stipulated time limit in other to earn the respective rewards.

- **Special Challenges** — These are the challenges which do not fit into the rotative class or are challenges from special events. Their availability may differ from user to user. Always keep an eye out for them.

  **Tip:** _No type of multiplier bonus is applied to challenges._
