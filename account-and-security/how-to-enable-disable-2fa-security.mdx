5. Once you've scanned the QR code (or entered the Setup Key manually), your authentication app will **generate a 6 digit code** that repeatedly expires and refreshes within a short time frame. **Copy the 6 digit code** from your authentication app and paste into the assigned box. Then click "**_Confirm_**"

7. Upon successfully setting up 2FA configuration for your account, you'll be presented with a set of **Recovery codes** (as shown in the image below). **Store the Recovery codes in a secure place**.
