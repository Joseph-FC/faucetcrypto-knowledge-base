title: "When do PTC ads get refresh/reset? How can I get more?"
---

There is no estimated time for PTC ads to refresh. PTC ads are random and only become available when placed by **Advertisers**. So, depending on the number of views available in these ads, only then will you be able to view them again after a 24-hour period.

A tip for getting more PTC ads is to be active on the website in order to get more when they become available. For example, visiting the site periodically to claim from the faucet gives you a better chance to get more PTC ads when they are posted.
