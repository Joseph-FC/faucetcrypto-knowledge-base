**Faucet Crypto** is a free multi-coin faucet that rewards users with small amounts of cryptocurrencies for completing easy tasks. The term "**Faucet**" is used because the amount of cryptocurrencies given is small — just like water droplets from a faucet.

Below you can find a list of the **tasks** that can be done on our website to earn free **cryptocurrencies**:

1. **Faucet Claim** - This is a classic task which exists in a typical crypto faucet. You will wait for periodical intervals to elapse, and then click on "_Get Reward_".
2. **PTC Advertisements** - This is the fastest task. You will only watch advertised websites. If you get interested in the website, you may visit it later.
3. **Social Jobs** -  This type of task involves completion of various actions across a handful of social media channels. Typically, they can include: retweets of specific tweets from our Twitter page; writing detailed reviews about our website; making a tweet/post & recommending our website within it _etc._
4. **Offerwalls & Surveys** - This task is the most robust. You will open a panel where you can carry out several different tasks like answer surveys/questionnaires, watching videos and downloading applications. 
5. **Contests** - This is unique to our service. You may participate in various contests when available for huge amounts of coins.

  **Tips:** _Faucet Crypto has a similar style to an RPG game. You can use items, sell items on the market to real players, and level up\!_
