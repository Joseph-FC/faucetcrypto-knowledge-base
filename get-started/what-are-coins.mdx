title: "What are Coins?"
---

**Faucet Crypto** has a similar style to an RPG game. **Coins** is a **fictitious currency** which the site uses as its own **internal currency**. It (Coins) has a **fixed price in USD** and does not follow the price fluctuation of the regular cryptocurrency as can be seen on the cryptocurrency market. Coins can be cashed out (withdrawn) once you accumulate the minimum amount required to request a withdrawal.

Upon requesting a withdrawal, the value of your coins in USD will be converted into the real-time amount of the cryptocurrency you will receive. Coins can also be used to purchase items on the website to boost your earnings.

You can find both your Coins balance and it's real-time equivalent amount of your selected favorite cryptocurrency at the top of your **Dashboard**.
